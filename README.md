To run the animal database use intelliJ to run LogIn.html inside of the app/HTMLFiles. If you try to run the html file with the browser directly it might not display properly for feed animals.
The credentials to log in to the account is:
User A
username: a
password: a

User B
username: b
username: b

Image of the credentials will be posted in the Images folder if needed and the hardcoded credentials can be found in LogIn.js under the app/Javascript folder.
